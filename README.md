# Hello!
> Let's talk about making it better.

We here at Synoptic Data want your input on things we can improve and issues with our many products.  This is a general area to discuss these topics.  From here you can report a bug, request a feature or just talk directly to one of our developers.

**Getting involved is really easy!**

All you need to do is log into GitHub and [add an issue](https://github.com/synoptic/issues/issues).  You can search for open issues and discussions or start your own.

You can also report a bug and things that seem suspect, just add the "Bug" tag to the product and one of our developers will be sure to see it.
